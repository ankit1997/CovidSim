[Work In Progress!]

<b>A covid-19 simulation game.</b>

Covid-19 has taken over the world as we all know (27-06-2020). But even in times like these, we can try to take a different perspective on this and find out what might work to minimize the spread.
While many are working towards building a vaccine which may ultimately fix this problem, I thought we all can experiment on what might work to minimize the spread.
The main entity being blamed across the world is the government! So I thought we can all be the governments in this mini-game and modify our country policies to minimize the spread.

Inspired by [3b1b animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs)

Any suggestions are welcome!

To run animation, run:

`> streamlit run streamlit_ui.py`
